#Perry's prototyping readme

Why did I create an entirely new folder for my stuff? Why not modify just index.html?
Welp, it's because all this garbage in here is distracting and wasting my time.
Here's a list of stuff that's pointless to our project at this time:
- any .json file, we're not using angular yet, we're not using node yet.
    - actually, for that matter, any of the files not in a folder in SDD_SmallProject at this time besides .gitignore and the README.md.
- all of node_modules.
